My name is Shuzhou Yang, and I am a 2-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Jian Zhang](https://jianzhang.tech/).

Previously, I received my B.Eng degree from the [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2022. My primary research interests include computer vision and deep learning, mainly focusing on Novel View Synthesis and Image Enhancement.

# üìú Research Area
1. Novel View Synthesis (e.g., NeRF)
2. Generative Model (e.g., GAN, Diffusion)
3. Low-Level Vision (e.g., Image Enhancement)
